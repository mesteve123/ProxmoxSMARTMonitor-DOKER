Hello everyone! üëã I'm a tech enthusiast who loves testing things at home and running a small homelab. I currently have two Proxmox hosts running various services. These aren‚Äôt "enterprise-grade servers" just "regular machines" and I don‚Äôt have RAID setups to have greater redundancy or remote management interfaces like iDRAC or iLO to easily check disk health.

While Proxmox includes a SMART tool, I found it limited and not very user-friendly. I tried several other tools, but most were either too complex to set up or didn‚Äôt really work for my needs.

So, with zero programming experience and a lot of help from artificial intelligence, I created ProxmoxSMARTMonitor, a simple, visual, and easy-to-use web tool to check the health of your disks on a Proxmox server.

üöÄ Downloading and Launching Docker:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mesteve123/ProxmoxSMARTMonitor-DOKER
    ```
```bash
    cd ProxmoxSMARTMonitor-DOKER
    ```
```bash
    sudo docker build -t proxmox-smart-monitor .
    ```
```bash
    sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name proxmox-smart-monitor proxmox-smart-monitor
    ```

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note:

This tool was created primarily with the help of AI. Its correct functioning is not guaranteed, and it is not recommended for use in professional environments.

If you‚Äôd like to support more projects like this, donations are appreciated. You can do so from the link at the bottom of the application.

Thanks for stopping by! I'm open to feedback, suggestions, and contributions. Every bit of help is welcome üôå
